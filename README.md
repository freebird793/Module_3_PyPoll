# Module_3_PyPoll

## Project Overview
I was given a sample dataset from a Colorado Board of Elections results in a .csv file and my objective was to parse through the data to accurately and comprehensively summarize the election results and create a legible .txt file to house the results. The factors I deemed important to represent and analyze are listed below.

  1. Calculate the total number of votes cast.
  2. Get a complete list of candidates who received votes.
  3. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received.
  4. Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won.
  5. Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote.
  6. Identify the participating counties.
  7. Calculate the total number of votes & percentage each county received.
  8. Determine which county had the most voters.

## Resources
- Data Source: election_results.csv
- Software: Python 3.9, Visual Code, 1.57

## Summary
The analysis of the election show that:

  - There were 369,711 total votes cast in the election.

  - The county that had the most voter activity was Denver with 82.8% of the votes. (306,055)

  - The candidates were:
    - Charles Casper Stockham
    - Diana DeGette
    - Raymon Anthony Doane

  - The candidate results were:
    - Charles Casper Stockham received 23.0% of the vote and 85,213 votes.
    - Diana DeGette received 73.8% of the vote and 272,892 votes.
    - Raymon Anthony Doane received 3.1% of the vote and 11,606 votes.
  - The winner of the election was:
    - Diana DeGette, who received 73.8% of the vote and 272,892 votes.

### Challenge Overview
Being that this was my first time using python there were many challenges. But the one challenge python that really stood out was its syntax and indentations. Learning the heirarchy of the language was different than anything else I have done before. The other major challenge that I faced was the committing of certain files and the commands that go with it in python. It was a huge learning curve for me to access files via the command line and assign operations (print, read, write etc.) in the aforementioned folders.
